# Reflection: Creating Story Map 

**1. Process of Creating Story Map...**

The process of creating the data for my Story Map was quite simple. We had to track ourselves for a week and record the data 
into an excel document. I did not find that too difficult but was immediately able to recognize the areas and places I spend the
most time. Building my map in ARCGIS Online was actually very enjoyable for me. This has been my favorite assignment so far, as
I was able to organize things the way I wanted and create a personable space where I can organize my data. I feel that with the
Story Map I was able to be creative and create a unique place to show my work through a interactive journal. The points I decided
to select in my Map were very different. I tried my best to use many features to fully take advantage of my Map and be more unique
in my creation of my Map. As I mentioned before, I found Mapping and Spatial Analysis to be, by far, my favorite form of Digital Humanities Analysis so far. I feel that through the process of working with different kinds of data and different projects, you are able to find what you really enjoy most. As I have found this project to be my favorite, I will continue my 
skills in this area and use it in my final project. 

**2. Constraints, Critiques and Ideas...**

As Bodenhamer and Crampton discussed in the readings, there are some challenges in representing space and place in Story Maps.
I do feel that it is important to recognize these ideas, but then build from them. I found that some constraints were specific
word choice when labeling your data. As in Topic Modeling and Text Mining, the programs are very sensitive to word choice and 
spelling. I found that in my data I miss labeled "Westhampton Hall" three different ways and my data was sorted into three
different categories based on my spelling. Although this is an issue, in the future I know to be very specific and tetious about
my data and its labels. These issues though, are all minor and are apart of the learning process of building models. 

**3. Limits and Possibilites...** 

There are limits and possibilites to everything, and specifically Mapping and Spatial Analysis. This is not an issue though, 
because again, as I mentioned before, building these kinds of models is all apart of the learning process. The limits include
the amount of data and the space range the data consists of. Although there are many of limits, the possibilites are endless. With 
Mapping and Spatial Data/ Analysis we are able to create models, and journals to help advance technology. These maps can be used
for all kinds of subjects and can continue to advance our knowledge.
