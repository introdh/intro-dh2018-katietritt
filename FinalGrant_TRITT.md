## Award Levels:
My grant is a Level II grant. Level II awards (from $50,001 to $100,000) are larger grants that can be used for formed projects that have completed initial planning phase. Level II proposals should therefore include a more articulated plan of work leading to concrete and tangible outcomes such as working prototypes; detailed plans for upgrading existing or defunct projects in need of substantive revision, enhancement, or recovery; test beds; or demonstration projects. My project does not need a large amount of funding to start, and that is why I chose a Level II grant.

## Narrative: 
## Enhancing the Humanities: 
My ultimate goal of my grant is to develop a forum for individuals in areas of homelessness to share their stories and their efforts of recovering. This project will help spread awareness of areas and individuals in areas of homelessness and allow others to find ways in which they can help to eliminate and eradicate poverty and homelessness. Throughout this project, many activities will take place to help us determine and analyze where the highest areas of homelessness in the United States exist. First, we will have our collaborators team up to research the current areas in the United States with the highest rates of homelessness. They will carefully conduct this research through analysis of scholarly cites, articles, maps and graphs to collect the most valid information. They will then process this information and put it into our own maps. We will layer our maps and create visuals to view our results. Then we will use the specific cities with the highest levels of poverty first. We will narrow our research, focusing on the top three cities in the United States. After conducting more research and finding the similarities and differences between all three cities, we will gather all of our research and results to further our knowledge and project. Then through careful and thoughtful analysis, we will lead our Director and Co-Director to the three cities to interview and work side by side with individuals living in these areas. This part of the project is the most sensitive and time consuming. We must allow valuable time for relationships to form with these individuals that way they feel comfortable working with our team and sharing their stories. After building these relationships and learning about these individuals living in areas of high poverty and homelessness, we will genuinely ask them about their efforts of recovering from the life they are currently living. With thorough analysis of their stories and efforts of recovering, we will give these individuals the option of sharing their story on a forum where they will be heard. Our goal is to work with these individuals and hopefully make them feel comfortable enough to the point where they want to be heard by many. The ultimate result of our project is to create a forum where these individuals can be heard and have it made known that they have a story that is worth being heard. We want to do this so that we can create awareness and create teams who will help eradicate and eliminate poverty. This project has intellectual value coming from all aspects. From scholars to students, to the common general audience, we can intellectually enlightened individuals in all concentrations. Giving individuals living in homelessness a voice, and allowing that voice to be heard by scholars, students and any audience will spread awareness while also humbling the more fortunate. The scope of this project is quite small to start. Our team will be analyzing the United States and the top three cities with the highest levels of homelessness. The scope of the activities in comparison is quite large. After conducting our research, we will be traveling to the cities with the highest levels of homelessness. Then, we will be meeting with the homeless while trying to empathize with them. These projects will be difficult, but will ultimately produce life changing results. There are many major questions of this project, the most common which include; What are the areas currently in the United States with the highest levels of homelessness? What are the top three cities currently in the United States with the highest levels of homelessness? What are the commonalities amongst these areas? Does race have any relationship to homelessness in the specific area? Why are these individuals homeless? What is their story? This project furthers humanitie inquiries in multiple disciplines by answering questions and understanding economic inequality within society. Economic inequality is hard to understand and grasp the root cause, but after hearing specific individuals stories, we hope to grow a better understanding. Throughout this project, my team and I will be using different Digital Humanities Methods to help reach our goal. The method that we will use in this project most often is Spatial Map Analysis, while discovering the “spaces” and “places” were homelessness is most prominent. This method if found to be most useful for analysis of our data which we will then layer onto maps to help visualize and determine the areas in the United States with the highest rates of homelessness and poverty. Through visualization of the maps, we will be able to recognize the areas that we will build on in the project. “Space” and “Place” will be most beneficial as we are first identifying the “spaces” in the United States with the highest rates of homelessness, and then identifying what exactly that “place” looks like. This method will help us address our central research questions. The platform and standards we will work upon will be clearly stated and identified before our research begins. NEH views the use of open-source software as a key component in the broad distribution of exemplary digital scholarship in the humanities. This project will employ generally accessible open-source software which will help us tremendously. NEH’s dissemination goals will be satisfied once this project is completed. We will meet the dissemination goals by creating our forum where the individuals can be heard. Our project exactly, will be the direct act of spreading information widely. 
## Environmental Scan: 
Although there are some projects similar to this one, I find this to be the most unique. We are not just conducting research, but trying to find a solution to the problem. A similar project that has been conducted is the Anti-Eviction Project. This project is a data-visualization, data analysis, and storytelling collective documenting the dispossession and resistance upon gentrifying landscapes. Primarily working in the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, and New York City, they are all volunteers producing digital maps, oral history work, film, murals, and community events. Working with a number of community partners and in solidarity with numerous housing movements, they study and visualize new entanglements of global capital, real estate, technocapitalism, and political economy. Their narrative oral history and video work centers the displacement of people and complex social worlds, but also nodes of resistance. Maintaining anti racist and feminist analyses as well as decolonial methodology, the project creates tools and disseminates data contributing to collective resistance and movement building. We see that this is similar to our project as the Anti-Eviction Mapping Project also narrows their research specifically on three different areas. That is our goal as well, but to then broaden our knowledge on other areas in the United States. When we create our forum, we will set it up similarly to the Anti-Eviction Project. Their cite contains many visuals, maps, writings, reports, and even a section where you can share your story. Our goal is to create something simple, were we will include all of these things, as well as a place to share your story and efforts of recovery. But, to go along with individuals sharing their stories, we will allow outside sources to comment. This will be filtered before it is posted, so that we are only supporting and encouraging others. Also, outside sources will be able to find ways that they can help eradicate homelessness and poverty in the United States. The Anti-Eviction Mapping Project relates to our project as we are both working to end something. Both of the projects are working to help solve questions of the humanities. We are aware that there are many projects similar to ours, but our proposed project contributes to and advances the field of the humanities in many ways unlike others. We want to make every effort we can to eradicate homelessness and poverty in the United States and by creating these safe forums of encouragement and support, I would say is the start of something amazing. 
## History of the Project: 
The origination of this idea rooted from passion itself. I am passionate about homelessness and individuals living in poverty. I feel that we as humans often times judge individuals without having any sympathy or interest in hearing about their lives or what led them to this point. Every individual's situation varies, and not one is the same. If we create a forum and allow individuals to be heard, and show the more fortunate that individuals living in homelessness have a story, more people will be apt to help eradicate it. I have done much research on homelessness and the idea of eradication and elimination in the United States, but it is quite complex and harder to end then we think. If we provide awareness to the more fortunate, and a voice for the less, we will be able to take steps towards the right direction. After the period of performance of the project, we would create the forum where individuals could share their stories. With your support and the support of our nation, we could help solve the questions of social and economic inequality as well as support each other in a way that would be beneficial in creating results. This project is the first idea produced, and not the revitalization of another. We plan to create a project that we can continue to build on and work to improve. So although there is not much history of this project, we hope that this young project may inspire others and be the origination and beginning of many more like this one. 

## Work Plan: 
Throughout this project, there will be many tasks that will need to be completed in a timely manner in order for everything to flow smoothly. The projected time period of this project is 2 years. Each staff member is responsible for certain tasks that must be completed promptly. Below are a list of the tasks as well as the staff members responsible for each component of the project. 
- Research: Staff Members Responsible (Entire Staff): The reason that the entire staff will be working on this component of the project is because it requires a lot of time and is the major foundation of the project. By conducting research with a large group, we will have  a large amount of data with we can then analyze. Staff members can work Individually, or in small groups. Once the research is conducted and each member has a set of data, the staff will come together and analyze the data. After all of the data is analyzed and grouped, we will give a specific group of staff members the next task. The data will be based on homeless currently in the United States. After finding data on this topic we will narrow it down to the top three cities in the United States with the highest rates of homelessness. Once these cities are found, we will continue to analyze the data to find similarities and differences amongst the areas. 
- Map Layering/Visualizations: Advisory Board Members: The next task will be to take the data we have analyzed and use Spatial Map/Analysis to layer our data onto maps. This will help us visualize the data and find more commonalities and differences. Through the maps we create, when the project is complete, these will be the same maps that will be available to view on the forum. With the data completed, the Advisory Board Members will also create a means of visualizations to help understand the data. These visualizations may include, but are not limited to, graphs, maps, charts, 3-Dimensional diagrams, ect. Once these visualizations are complete, the staff members responsible will conduct a presentation to the rest of the staff. These maps and visualizations will help us move on to the next task.
Creating Forum: Collaborators: The responsibility of this task is to create the forum that the homeless individuals will be sharing their stories on. This forum will be a website, similar to the Anti-Eviction Mapping Site, which will consist of tabs like: About Us, Share Your Story, Ways to Help, Spatial Maps, Map Analysis, Feedback, Donations and a Contact Us tab. The task of the staff members is to create an organized, simple environment which will be beneficial to not only the less fortunate, but the fortunate. Our goal is to create a forum where individuals will learn that poverty is not a choice and everyone has a story. By creating this, we are on the right track to eradicating homelessness and poverty in the United States, by spreading awareness to all. 
- Travel: Project Director and Project Co-Director: After the research has been conducted which gives us information about the top 3 cities in the United States with the highest rates of homelessness, we will then travel to these areas. This part of the project is one of the most crucial in regards to the ultimate outcome. The goal of the staff members responsible for this task will be to become familiar with the area in which they are located. The next task is to build relationships with the homeless individuals in the area over time and let them know that you empathize with them and you understand that they have a story. After building a strong connection with the homeless individuals, making them feel safe and comfortable, it is important to ask them about their story as well as their efforts of recovery. Once those individuals share their stories and efforts of recovery, it is the staff members job to ask the homeless individuals if they would like to share their story to a larger group of people. Having these individuals share their stories is one of the first steps in the process of eradicating homelessness.
- Growth of Forum: Staff Members Responsible (Entire Staff): The last step of the work plan, after the stories are shared on the forum is to keep the forum and stories alive. After these individuals share their stories it is our goal that through their vulnerability we will be able to help them in their efforts of recovery. As well as helping the individuals in poverty, we hope that their stories spread awareness to the more fortunate, who we hope will be willing to help the epidemic of homelessness. If we all work together we will be able to take steps in the right direction to eradicate and eliminate poverty in the United States. 
There are many risks involved in this project, but without risks, we will not find growth. Our strategies in mitigating the risks involve continuing to pursue our passion and our relationship with the homeless individuals so forth creating a more comfortable relationship with them. The plans for evaluating the results of the project will be analyzed as the task is completed. Many of our team and staff members mentors will be analyzing our project from the outside. Throughout the course of this project, we will constantly be checking in with the tasks and responsibilities at hand. We must be prompt in our tasks and make sure that we are staying focused. We will set goals every three months and check our progress at the end period of that three months. Our ultimate and long term goal is to eradicate and end homeless in the United States and through this work plan, we will begin taking the right steps. 

## Final Product and Dissemination: 
This project in itself is self disseminating. We are creating and spreading awareness and communication to others through the forum we create. The forum will be a place of stories and feedback as well as ways that individuals can help contribute to the eradication of homelessness. We hope to spread awareness by getting permission to share countless individuals stories. Our project begins with the top three cities in the United States, but our goal is to reach as many cities as possible. We will make publications available in open access venues throughout the cities we travel to as well as the headquarters of our workplace. Our goal is to spread awareness. Our team of staff members are very passionate about our project, so we hope to spread awareness by word of mouth as well. The project will reach individuals with disabilities living in homelessness as well as the more fortunate. Our project does not discriminate and we want to reach people of every kind. Our software will be free and an open-source software. It will be made public through an online repository via GitHub.
