# Grant Workshop Response 

##1. Formulate the questions guiding the humanities project.


Throughout my project, the main questions guiding the project will be:
*What areas in the United States have the highest rates of poverty and homelessness?
*What are the commonalities amongst the areas with the highest rates?
*What steps must we take to eradicate and eliminate poverty and homelessness in these areas?

##2. Explanation of Project:

I will be identifying and analyzing the areas in the United States with high levels of poverty and homelessness. 
I have this idea as I am interested in findings areas of high levels of poverty and homelessness and what makes them alike 
and different. First, I will analyze the different areas of poverty. Then, I will find similarities and differences and try
to determine why those similarities and differences occur. Throughout my project, I will try to build different models and 
analyze them to find these commonalities and contrasts. After analyzing the space and area, my goal is to find journals, 
letters, articles and stories about these specific individuals who are living in poverty and homelessness and what led them 
to this point as well as answering questions of what is poverty, and why these individuals are living in poverty. My ultimate
goal of the grant is to create a voice for these individuals where people can hear their stories. The humanities can answer 
many questions in this project like, what areas in the United States is poverty and homelessness most prominent, as well as
the question of how these individuals are feeling. My plan and goal is to use “Space and Place” and GIS to answer my questions
of poverty and homelessness in the United States.
