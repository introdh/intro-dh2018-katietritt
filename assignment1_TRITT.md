# Written Response for Topic Modeling Assignment 1

I created my Topic Model around the basis of the Ancient Roman and Greek Empire through the lense of Race, Gender and Class. [here.](https://katietritt.github.io/dh-topic-models/) 

**1. What is the scope of the journal?**

The scope of this journal is understanding race, gender and class specifically within the Ancient Roman and Greek Empire. This journal has many connnections with Greek and Roman Mythology. Many of the journals include prehistoric literature and poetry. Through this group of journals, much of the context discussed includes information of Greek and Roman deities, philosophers, poets, gods, olympians, tragedians, and ancient infamous individuals in history. 

**2. What question(s) are you trying to answer?**

The questions which this journal answers involve race, gender and class through the lense of Ancient Roman and Greek literature. Through these journals, we are able to analyze prehistoric poetry, plays and literature to make deeper connections and have a better concept of race, gender and class in specific time periods. Through topic modeling, a form of text minining, we are able to recognize patterns, group words, find word frequencies and create carefully analyzed inferences about specific time periods and specific topics. 

**3. Which data did you select for the corpus?** 

The data I selected for my corpus, was strictly journals. The periodization for my group of journals was very broad and consists of a large range of dates. Through topic modeling, we see change over time, and a "reflection of movements" but I decided to work with a larger and more broad group of journals for my first Topic Model. Through doing so, I have a broader range of topics, but I am still able to see where certain connections and patterns form, while also learning specific reasons why things may co-occur or be grouped together. 

**4. Why the number of topics?**

I decided to work with a group of 25 topics. For my groups of journals, this was the best number that organized my data in the best way. I found that I was able to recognize certain patterns, words, similarities, and commonalities amongst my specific topics, as well as learning why the specific words were grouped together over others. Anything over 25 topics, became overwhelming for my size of data. In comparison, a number like 20 became too broad. While completing my topic model with a total of 25 topics, I found that this was the most beneficial choice for my size of data. 

**What are the initial findings and/or possible arguments?** 

The intial findings from this data are quite specific. We find that race, gender and class can all be narrowed into more specific categories and groups. A lot of Greek and Roman literature surround the idea of poetry, playwrights, and mythology. These topics tell us through poetry, plays, and stories a representation of what the race, gender and class may have looked like in the ancient Greek and Roman empires. We are then able to make inferences and educated analysis, as well as pose questions of more detail of what life was like in those prehistoric times. We see certain patterns and trends of mostly poetry and the role it played in both empires.

**What are the possibilities and limitations of text analysis and topic modeling?** 

There are endless possibilities the studies of topic modeling. Topic modeling "provides a new perspective on the history of literary studies, by revealing trends that are presently visible" (Goldstone, Andrew and Ted Underwood, JDH, 2012). We are able to analyze words and bring them into perspective and into consideration for analysis. Ideas tend to get lost in traditional reading and we find significant trends/transformations and changes in text mining and topic modeling. Through visualizing word frequencies, it offers advantages like coherently displaying general trends as well as revealing outliers and anomalies. Although there are countless possibilities through text analysis and topic modeling, there are also limitations. The output that topic modeling creates is not very readable, you mostly understand through visualization, but you must understand what the visualization is telling you. Also, sometimes you will notice uncorrelated topics, or find no evolution of topics over time. Topic modeling is created to broaden our knowledge and we can use this as a way of analysis of the humanities.
