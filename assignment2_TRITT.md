**What is a Network?**

A network is "a collection of points joined together in pairs by lines" (Newman 2010). We create networks to "visualize how documets or topics relate to one another" (Weingart, 2011). We can take information from scholarly databases and create a network of diagrams, graphs and visual aids to help us understand our topics and how they relate. We find that through these visual aids, we have a simple representation of the basic connection or relation amongst topics. 

**Data Selected**

The peices of data I selected for my network analysis' are Supreme Court cases ranging from 1970 to 1981 regarding Immigration and Naturalization Welfare Benefits as well as Access to Public Education. Citizanship through Naturalization is the process by which U.S. citizenship is grante to a foreign citizen or national after he or she fulfills the requirments established by Congress in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). While an immigrant is defined as a person who comes to live permantently in a foreign country. The Supreme Court cases used in my data discuss the Welfare Benefits given to these individuals as well as the immigrants access to public education. Through network analysis, we will be able to draw conclusions about how the two topics relate. 

**Questions and Arguments Generated by Network**

The two different kinds of cases being analyzed throughout this network are very different, but are also similar in many ways. We see that the Court Cases pose many questions about the process of naturalization, and once that is granted, the question of benefits and access to what immigrants should have in comparison to natural born citizens. After analysis and close reading of the court cases, we find that ultimately "access" to public education and welfare benefits poses much controversy to immigrants and citizens.

**Possibilities and Limits**

Networks are a great tool to be used, but there are also limitations and constraints. First we will discuss the possibilites of limits. Through analysis of networks we are able to simply find relation amongst topics and ideas. Through visual aids, graphs and charts, we are able to find connections and understand how topics fit together. In contrast, limitations to Networking exist. "Networks can be used on any project. Networks should be used on far fewer"(Weingart 2011). Also, methodology appropriation is dangerous. This means that as methodology gets translated over time, there can be danger in the "borrowing". Although there are constraints, we find that after analysis of this network, we are able to draw many connections between welfare benefits and access to public education. While immigrants are in the process of naturalization, or if the immigrants have gained their citizenship, their struggle to gain the same benefits and access to specific things comes into play for these individuals.
